<p>For the final project in Machine Elements we were tasked to design and build
a remote-controlled car in groups of five. These cars would then be raced against
each other at the end of the semester. This project was broken into three main
components that we would complete throughout the course: the chassis,
drive-train, and steering. These components only served to split up the
deliverables across three months; the design of the car by necessity was
iterative, meaning that we had to reconsider our exisiting designs once we
found something we had previously planned wouldn&rsquo;t work as intented. An example
of this is after we designed and cut the mounting holes into the chassis for
our motor mount, we realized the size of gears means they couldn&rsquo;t mesh
properly. This required us to go back and re-make the chassis to have vertical
mounting slots, so we could move the motor mount dynamically by loosening and
tightening the screws. Additionally, we had to redesign the motor mount to also
hold a shaft for an idler gear that would give us the space we needed in the
drive train.</p>

<p>The chassis was initially made to just be a flat piece of laser-cut acrylic,
which we could mount the eletrical and mechanical components to. We did a basic
FEA analysis in solidworks, pictured below, which showed that for the forces we
expected a single sheet of 1/8th inch acrylic would suffice. In hindsight we
should have designed some multilayered design because flexure between the front
and rear of the car proved to be an issue, especially where it impacted the
gear box. At the time we wanted to start with something simple we could build
the rest of the car around, and go back and edit if we saw any major problems.
The flexure issue was insignificant enough that by the time we finished
building the rest of the car we figured it hold up throughout the final race.</p>

<p>The drive-train design centered around the choice in the gear ratio. Using the
rated torque-speed curve of the provided motor and assuming the coefficient of
friction to be around 0.9, we estimated a desired gear ratio in the range of 3-7
between the motor and the wheels. To help give us more traction during the turns
and avoid wheel slippage we chose to make a rear driven car with a rear
differential. Initially we tried to 3D print the differential, but the gear
teeth were so weak that we decided to purchase a composite RC differential,
along with a metal pinion and idler gear. This durability ended up proving it&rsquo;s
worth during the race, when the groups using plastic gears found their teeth
completely worn off after a few laps. We purchased standard 10th scale RC tires,
dogbones, and axels, which made the rest of the drive-train design very simple.
After printing two back axel mounts and an adapter for the dogbones to
differential, the rear of our car was complete.</p>

<p>The last piece to design was the steering component, which ended up being the
most straight-forward component. A bell-crank desing was chosen because of the
rotational movement of the steering servo we were provided. All that we need to
make were linkages to connect the axel mounts to the steering servo and a couple
shoulder knuckles to set the angle of the rotation for each wheel. A simple
approximation using Ackerman geometery was used to solve for the length of the
linkages and the angle of the knuckles. All of these parts took less than half
an hour to print, and fit perfectly on the first attempt.</p>
