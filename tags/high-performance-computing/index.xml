      <description>Several of my colleagues at Oak Ridge National Labs (including myself) got involved in high performance computing through the Student Cluster Competition. More about the competition can be found at the competition website or in the post I wrote earlier when I competed, but essentially it challenges undergraduate students to design, build, and manage a small HPC cluster to run a set of scientific applications quickly and efficiently. This competition does a fantastic job of getting students involved in scientific computing and system engineering, and as such one of my coworkers wanted to host a team for 2019.</description>

      <description>During my parallel programming class I heard of an opportunity for students to build and configure a high performance computing cluster. I applied to join the six-person team and (surprisingly) was accepted. Over the next few months we practiced running applications on Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)&amp;rsquo;s systems, designed the hardware configuration of our cluster, and learned about Linux system management and control. My main tasks were running and tuning High Performance Linpack, writing scripts to automatically build, run, and generate matplotlib graphs that analyzed the performance of several applications.</description>

      <description>Solved velocity and pressure for flow through a 2 dimensional channel For the final project in my Parallel Programming class we were tasked with solving some problem using MPI on the HPC systems at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). I was taking Fluid Mechanics at the same time, and chose to replicate one of the labs we had completed about the development of laminar flow. With the MPI C++ bindings, I wrote a basic simulation which depicted the flow of fluid through a two dimensional channel in the terms of pressure and velocity of the fluid elements in a mesh.</description>
