Sorry, your browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t support embedded videos, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player!  In Fall of 2017 I took the Mechanical Engineering Design and Methodology course, as a precursor to Senior Design the next semester. This course was structured to teach methods through hands-on design work for a project throughout the semester. The project for this semester was to create a fire rescue robot with the goal of entering a high-temperature environment and locating an injured pet.</description>

      <description>In Fall of 2017 I took a course in Machine tool operation. This class met for 6 hours a week in the machine shop on campus and taught basic metalworking skills for use with manual lathes and mills, along with hands on experience in casting parts and generating G-Code to program CNC machines. After creating a couple practice parts using the mill and lathe we each constructed a moveable vice from scratch.</description>

      <description>For the final project in Machine Elements we were tasked to design and build a remote-controlled car in groups of five. These cars would then be raced against each other at the end of the semester. This project was broken into three main components that we would complete throughout the course: the chassis, drive-train, and steering. These components only served to split up the deliverables across three months; the design of the car by necessity was iterative, meaning that we had to reconsider our exisiting designs once we found something we had previously planned wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work as intented.</description>

      <description>Solved velocity and pressure for flow through a 2 dimensional channel For the final project in my Parallel Programming class we were tasked with solving some problem using MPI on the HPC systems at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). I was taking Fluid Mechanics at the same time, and chose to replicate one of the labs we had completed about the development of laminar flow. With the MPI C++ bindings, I wrote a basic simulation which depicted the flow of fluid through a two dimensional channel in the terms of pressure and velocity of the fluid elements in a mesh.</description>
