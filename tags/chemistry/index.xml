      <description>In high school I became fascinated with the operation of logic gates, and wanted to build a basic adder circuit, but in a new and innovative way. From my chemistry experience, I had learned about the metamaterial Vanadium Dioxide and it&amp;rsquo;s thermo-chromatic triggering properties. By following the manufacturing procedure outlined in Deki, Aoi, &amp;amp; Kajinami&amp;rsquo;s paper, I designed a set of optical logic gates using the Vanadium Dioxide thin films that would produce binary levels of infrared light.</description>
