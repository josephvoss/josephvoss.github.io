      <description>During my Mechanical Engineering Computational Methods class, the professor explained the basic operation of a processor. This re-ignited my interest in the function of low level logic gate operations. Initially I used logic-gate modeling software to try and design basic components like an Arithmetic Logic Unit, but after making some progress I moved to designing these components in Verilog so it could be ported to actual hardware on an FPGA board.</description>

      <title>Portable Bluetooth Display</title>

      <description>In a similar vein to the LED projector I attempted to build earlier, I wanted to create a portable text-only display. This time instead of creating a display from scratch, a small TFT display driven by an Arduino Nano was used to easily display the text. The data was sent to the display over a bluetooth connection from a Raspberry Pi. This Raspberry Pi was configured to connect to a bluetooth keyboard on start up, and run a small script which captured all input and piped it into a serial console hosted on a second bluetooth connection.</description>

      <description>After initially getting experience with the Linux command line through my experience working at Applied Research Laboratories over the Summer of 2014, I realized how much work could be done with a simple text-user-interface. Simultaneously, I wanted to have an ultra-portable PC, and realized that computing hardware was able to be minimized easily. The largest components of portable systems were the interfaces: the display and keyboard. Several portable keyboard options exist, but there&amp;rsquo;s no inexpensive portable display.</description>

      <title>Vanadium Dioxide Logic Gates</title>

      <description>In high school I became fascinated with the operation of logic gates, and wanted to build a basic adder circuit, but in a new and innovative way. From my chemistry experience, I had learned about the metamaterial Vanadium Dioxide and it&amp;rsquo;s thermo-chromatic triggering properties. By following the manufacturing procedure outlined in Deki, Aoi, &amp;amp; Kajinami&amp;rsquo;s paper, I designed a set of optical logic gates using the Vanadium Dioxide thin films that would produce binary levels of infrared light.</description>
