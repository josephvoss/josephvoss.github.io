        <h4>
Hi, my name is Joseph Voss. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of 
Texas at Austin with a specialty in Mechatronics, but I've spent a lot of time working 
with the Texas Advanced Computing Center and on various software problems. I'm an 
engineer through and through, and will use whatever tool I think is necessary to solve 
a problem, whether it be a wrench or a keyboard. In my free time I work on one of my 
many personal projects, listen to slam poetry, and play quidditch. If you'd like to 
contact me, please use one of the links shown above.
