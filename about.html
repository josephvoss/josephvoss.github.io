Hi, my name is Joseph Voss. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of 
Texas at Austin with a specialty in Mechatronics, but I've spent a lot of time working 
with the Texas Advanced Computing Center and on various software problems. I'm an 
engineer through and through, and will use whatever tool I think is necessary to solve 
a problem, whether it be a wrench or a keyboard. In my free time I work on one of my 
many personal projects, listen to slam poetry, and play quidditch. If you're interested in some of the projects I've done in my spare time, click the Projects tab above. If 
you'd like to contact me, please use one of the links above or email me at <a href="mailto:josephvoss14@gmail.com">josephvoss14@gmail.com</a>.
