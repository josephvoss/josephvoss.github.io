In Fall of 2017 I took a course in Machine tool operation. This class met for 6
hours a week in the machine shop on campus and taught basic metalworking skills 
for use with manual lathes and mills, along with hands on experience in casting
parts and generating G-Code to program CNC machines. After creating a couple
practice parts using the mill and lathe we each constructed a moveable vice from
scratch. This involved machining a vice body, threaded rod, sliding jaw, and
several small bushings and connectors. After constructing everything together we
blackened the vice to prevent it from rushing. A few pictures of my complete
vice are shown above, and the manual used to construct it is attached 
[here](Link.com).
